when to useReducer vs useState?

useReducer = reducers

reduce vs useReducer

         reduce                              useReducer
  array.reduce(reducer,initialValue)          useReducer(reducer,initialState)   

  singleValue = reducer(accumulator,itemvalue) newState = reducer(currentState,action)


reducer returns a single value          usereducers rerurn a pair of values [newState,dispatch]

//Summary
useReducer is a hook which is used for state management.
useReducer is related to reducer functions.
useReducer(reducer,initialState)
reducer(currentState,action)


useState Vs useReducer:-

Both are used for state management

useState is better option when Type of state is Number,String,Boolean.
useReducer is a better option when type of state is array and object.

if number of State transition is 1 or 2 useState is better otherwise UseReducer is better option.

if related state transitions are ther useReducer is better than useState

if there is complex business logic usereducer is better option useState is useful if there is no ligic we have to use.

useReducer is used when we have to do Global state managemnt.UseState is good gor local state management.
