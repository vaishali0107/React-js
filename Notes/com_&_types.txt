React components let you break up the user interface into separate pieces that can then be reused and handled independently.


Functional Components

    1) Functional components are basic JavaScript functions. These are typically arrow functions but can also be created with the regular function keyword.
    
    2) React lifecycle methods (for example, componentDidMount) cannot be used in functional components.
    3) There is no render method used in functional components.
    4)These are mainly responsible for UI and are typically presentational only (For example, a Button component).
    5)Functional components can accept and use props.
   6) Functional components should be favored if you do not need to make use of React state.
   
Class Components

    1)Class components make use of ES6 class and extend the Component class in React.
    2)Sometimes called “smart” or “stateful” components as they tend to implement logic and state.
    3)React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components (for example, componentDidMount).
    4)You pass props down to class components and access them with this.props
